# Roadmap
As Kuveyt Türk, Turkey's leading participation bank with its technology and investments on innovation, we are implementing the first Open Source Banking application. We are granting access to some of the codes of BOA, our digital banking platform which we have developed with our own resources, in such a way that it would be accessible from anywhere in the world. With this initiative, we aim to make an important contribution to the open source ecosystem and benefit from the ecosystem. 

As Kuveyt Türk, we will continue to implement and develop world standards regarding the open banking. Our aim is to provide the easiest application infrastructures, API services and libraries in order for all Fintechs to develop products, which would like to develop financial products. For this purpose, we launched our first API market and implemented 75 financial APIs and unveiled them for production. We have released our open source coded SDKs for easy product development by using our API services. And as of this moment we even thought about fintech's own interfaces. We have unveiled our UI framework and UI components to the whole world, which we have developed with material design principles to develop products easier, by having them open source. Now we would like to develop the sharable parts of our codes with the whole ecosystem. 

Gradually increasing our open source codes and components are in our roadmap. You can review the component set and framework properties that we have unveiled. In the upcoming period, we will continue to unveil new components by taking your requests into consideration. We are always open to code enhancements, designing requests, and component requests from you.

In short; there is API, there is API SDK, there is UI framework, there are UI components, there is the documentation, that’s plenty. All the necessary materials are ready. Let’s develop disruptive financial products and services together...
